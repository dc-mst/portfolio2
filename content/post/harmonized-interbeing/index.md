While the process of intertwining humans and machines advances in contemporary society[^1], a new reality that defies conventional linguistic descriptions emerges. While natural languages can convey a wealth of meaning, they often fall short in capturing the intricate nuances and complexities of this new intertwined existence. In this context instrumental music emerges as a captivating medium capable of capturing the zeitgeist of our era.

## A Language Beyond Words
Instrumental music, unbound by the limitations of verbal expression, possesses a unique ability to communicate on a deeply emotional and intuitive level. By evoking sensations, moods, and atmospheres without the reliance on linguistic meanings, it offers a profound insight into the multilayered reality created by the interconnectedness of humans and machines. In a realm where words struggle to articulate the intricacies of this new reality, instrumental music fills the void, acting as a vessel for unspeakable narratives.

## The Sonic Landscape
The contemporary sonic landscape is rich with diverse sounds and influences from both organic and artificial origins. It mirrors the harmonious coexistence of humans and machines, their symbiotic relationship, and the fusion of the analog and digital realms. Instrumental music, with its vast range of timbres, textures, and sonic possibilities, becomes a sonic palette for artists to depict this intertwinedness. Through intricate melodies, pulsating rhythms, and innovative sound design, instrumental compositions speak to the merging of natural and formal domains.

## Emotional Resonance
One of the fundamental aspects of music is its ability to evoke emotions. In an era where humans and machines collaborate and co-create, the emotional landscape becomes a complex web of feelings. Instrumental music has the power to channel and express these nuanced emotional states that surpass linguistic boundaries. Whether it is the contemplation of the vastness of computational power or the yearning for genuine human connection in a digital world, instrumental compositions capture the emotional essence of a this added layer of reality that's ever present in the human experience, more and more difficult to separate from the old reality.

## Embracing Ambiguity
The intertwining of humans and machines generates a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the definition of reality. Natural languages often struggle to articulate essentially ambiguous concepts without trying to straighten them: are we supposed to revise the truth conditions of most of our statements, now that we are uncertain about what reality is? Instrumental music goes in another direction: it embraces ambiguity and thrives in the spaces between certainty and uncertainty. Instrumental compositions provide a sense of agency and empowerment, enabling individuals to make meaning in a reality that eludes linguistic categorization.

As humans and machines continue to intertwine, instrumental music emerges as a form of expression that encapsulates the zeitgeist of our contemporary society. Through its unique ability to transcend linguistic barriers, instrumental compositions reveal the intricate nuances, emotions, and complexities of this interconnected era. By embracing the ambiguity and offering a sonic landscape to explore, instrumental music invites us to contemplate the profound merging of humans and machines in a new reality that natural language alone cannot fully capture. In this new reality, instrumental music becomes a universal language[^2], connecting us to the essence of our intertwined existence.
