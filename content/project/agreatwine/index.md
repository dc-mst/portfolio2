The AGReATWine project aims at creating an extensive database of Italian wines within the esteemed DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) and DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata) appellations. 

The project goal is to provide wine enthusiasts, connoisseurs, and industry professionals with a comprehensive resource that aggregates expert reviews by vintage, allowing wine lovers to plan their next buy.
