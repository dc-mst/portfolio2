## $ whoami

I'm a geeky guy, mathematician by education and self-taught developer. Wine and cats lover, fond of all things GNU/Linux related.

I'm currently rebasing myself in Bologna (Italy) and looking for a job here, after some years abroad.

I've been involved with software development for more than 15 years, becoming knowledgeable in many areas of systems, cloud computing, and various other fields like:

- Python programming
- Linux Servers
- Cloud Computing
- Operating Systems
- IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- Networking
- Cloud Native technologies

I enjoy attend meetups and events to learn about new technologies, talk with interesting people and exchange stickers.

I'm active on Github and do not enjoy modern social platform like Instagram, Twitter, etc.
